#!/bin/bash

# This script is used to manage the seeding job for the CinePik Catalog application in the Kubernetes cluster.
# It can either delete and recreate the seeding job or just delete it based on the provided flag.
#
# Usage:
#   ./run-seed-job.sh            - Deletes the existing seeding job (if any) and recreates it.
#   ./run-seed-job.sh -c         - Only deletes the existing seeding job without recreating it.
#   ./run-seed-job.sh --clean-only - Same as above; only deletes the existing seeding job.
#
# Arguments:
#   -c, --clean-only: Optional flag to indicate that only cleanup (deletion) of the existing job should be performed.
#
# The script expects a Kubernetes job definition file named 'seed-job.yml' in the same directory as the script.
# It uses 'kubectl' commands to interact with the Kubernetes cluster, so ensure 'kubectl' is installed and configured correctly.
